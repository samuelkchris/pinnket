# PinnKET Ticket Transfer Policy

**Last Update: 7<sup>th</sup> March 2024.**

At **PinnKET**, we understand that plans can change, and you may need to transfer your purchased tickets to someone else. To facilitate this process and ensure a smooth experience for all parties involved, we have developed the following ticket transfer policy:

**1. Eligibility for Transfer:**

- Only tickets purchased directly from **PinnKET** through **PinniTAGS** are eligible for transfer.

- Tickets obtained through resale platforms or third-party vendors may not be eligible for transfer through **PinnKET**.

**2. Transfer Process:**

- Ticket transfers must be initiated by the original purchaser through their **PinnKET** account.

- The original purchaser will need to provide the email address or device information of the recipient for the transfer to be completed.

- Once the transfer is initiated, both the recipient and the purchaser will receive email notifications or confirmations on their devices, indicating the transfer request.

- The original purchaser will also receive a verification code or confirmation email to confirm the transfer request. This step enhances the security of the transfer process by requiring confirmation from the original purchaser before the transfer is finalized.

- After 30 minutes, if the transfer is still pending, it shall be automatically canceled. This ensures that transfers are promptly completed and prevents indefinite pending status.

**3. Validity of Transferred Tickets:**

- Upon completion of the transfer process, the transferred tickets will be valid only for the recipient specified during the transfer.

- The original purchaser's tickets will be invalidated, and they will no longer have access to the event or service associated with the tickets.

**4. Limitations and Restrictions:**

- Tickets can typically be transferred only once. Subsequent transfers may not be allowed or may be subject to additional fees or restrictions.

- Some events or services may have specific transfer policies or limitations imposed by the event organizers or service providers. In such cases, **PinnKET** will adhere to these policies.

**5. Cancellation and Refunds:**

- Once tickets are transferred, they may become non-refundable and non-transferable again. Refund policies will depend on the terms set forth by the event organizers or service providers.

- **PinnKET** reserves the right to modify or update its transfer policy at any time without prior notice.

By adhering to this transfer policy, we aim to facilitate ticket transfers while maintaining the security and integrity of our platform. If you have any questions or require assistance regarding ticket transfers, please contact our customer support team.

2. **Commission**: 
   - A Commission of 7% will be deducted from the total ticket price for each transaction. This fee contributes towards transaction processing and platform maintenance expenses. This fee is incurred by the Event Owner.

3. **SMS Handling Fee**:
   - For every ticket purchase made using the SMS (Short Message Service) channel, a handling fee of 500 UGX will be applied. This fee covers the operational costs of sending and managing SMS notifications related to ticket purchases. This fee is incurred by the ticket buyer.

4. **USSD Handling Fee**:
   - Utilizing the USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) channel for ticket purchases will incur an automatic SMS notification, thereby triggering the SMS handling fee of 500 UGX for each USSD transaction.

6. **Transfer Fee**:
   - In case of ticket transfers, the first transfer of a ticket is free, but any subsequent transfers of the same ticket shall incur the Administration Fee.

### Pricing Calculations:

- **For Ticket Purchaser**:
   - Total Price Paid = Ticket Price + Administration Fee (+ SMS Handling Fee, if applicable) + Transaction Fees

- **For Event Owner**:
   - Total Earnings = Ticket Price – Commission

### Use Cases:
**A: Ticket Purchaser**
a) Purchase with the platform without SMS enabling:
   - Total Price Paid = Ticket Price + Administration Fees + Transaction Fees
   - Total Price Paid = (10,000 + 1,000) UGX + Transaction Fees
   - Total Price Paid = 11,000 UGX + Transaction Fees

b) Purchase with platform with SMS enabling:
   - Total Price Paid = Ticket Price + Administration Fees + SMS Handling Fee + Transaction Fees
   - Total Price Paid = (10,000 + 1,000 + 500) UGX + Transaction Fees
   - Total Price Paid = 11,500 UGX + Transaction Fees

c) Purchase with USSD:
   - Total Price Paid = Ticket Price + Administration Fees + SMS Handling Fee + Transaction Fees
   - Total Price Paid = (10,000 + 1,000 + 500) UGX + Transaction Fees
   - Total Price Paid = 11,500 UGX + Transaction Fees

**B: Event Owner**
   - Total Earnings = Ticket Price – Commission
   - Total Earnings = [10,000 – (7% of 10,000)] UGX
   - Total Earnings = 9,300 UGX

**8**. **Ticket POS Sales**:
    - We have an option of selling physical tickets through a Point of Sale (POS) using our Stellify Pass app available on the Google Play Store. With this option, tickets are sold using credits owned by the event creator within the PinniTAGS system. Please note that these tickets cannot be transferred but can be downloaded from the PinnKET platform.


**9**. **Pricing Transparency**:
   - We are committed to maintaining transparency in our pricing structure, ensuring that customers are informed about all associated fees before completing their ticket purchases.
